# obs-dfo
Dropped frame counter overlay plugin for OBS Studio

This little plugin allows you to advertise your slow internet provider (like Time Warner)
right on your stream with a dropped frame counter overlay. You can put it over
ISP logo like that:

![obs-dfo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nitrocaster/obs-dfo/master/doc/obs-dfo.png)

Or you can add any static text before and after the counter:

![obs-dfo_static_txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nitrocaster/obs-dfo/master/doc/obs-dfo_static_txt.png)

You can find the background picture used in the first example in [doc/](https://github.com/nitrocaster/obs-dfo/blob/master/doc/timewarner_bg.png).

For the best look with this background picture, stretch the text box over the desireable width, open *Scene Item Transform* dialog and set the following parameters:

- *Positional Alignment* = *Center*
- *Alignment in Bounding Box* = *Center*
- *Bounding Box Type* = *Scale to inner bounds*
